# ValuationBOT project

## Version 1.0

### Simple feature list
* Pull SEC links of companies from a list
* Download the latest 10-Q filing using handmade script in an Excel format
* Pull out values from the file and download stock price of Yahoo! Finance
* Calculate the enterprise value and debt-to-cash ratio

### Acknowledgements
* The script downloads a filing if and only if it is on the first page
  * This might get fixed in this version or the next one
* Different companies call their debt and net income differently
  * Fixable by manualling going through filings and finding the most used combinations of words
* Saving the values of EV and leverage could be done if needed
