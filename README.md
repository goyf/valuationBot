# ValuationBOT

ValuationBOT scans a list of companies and tries to evaluate their cost

How it should work:
1. Valuation bot receives a link to an SEC website
2. Downloads the first 10-Q filling on the list
3. Evaluates it somehow
4. If undervalued, it saves it to a list

To-do list:
1. Load SP500 companies - Done
2. Visit their SEC page - Done
3. Find 10-Q for each of the companies and download it - Done
4. Do some basic valuation
5. Either dump or save the company
